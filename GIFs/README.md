# Example GIFs from Medical Datasets

This folder contains animated GIFs demonstrating the slice propagation process enhanced with Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) methods across three different medical imaging datasets. These visualizations aim to showcase the effectiveness of our approach in various contexts and highlight the impact of UQ integration on prediction accuracy and reliability.


## Viewing the GIFs

To view a GIF, simply click on the file name. Each GIF is named according to the dataset and the specific example it represents, making it easy to navigate and find relevant demonstrations.

We hope these visual demonstrations help elucidate the slice propagation technique and its benefits for medical image segmentation, particularly when enhanced with UQ for increased reliability and accuracy.
